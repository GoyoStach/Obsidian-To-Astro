# Zettlekasten to Astro

## ðŸ§¾Context

This project have the goal of exposing my obsidian notes to the web. The idea of developping such a tool came to me when i saw a video of [Takuya Matsuyama](https://github.com/craftzdog) :

## ðŸ“šStack

- ðŸš€[Astro](https://astro.build/) - Astro is anÂ **all-in-one**Â **web framework**Â for buildingÂ **fast,**Â **content-focused**Â websites.
- âš›[React](https://beta.reactjs.org/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- âŒ¨[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Rapidly build modern websites without ever leaving your HTML.

## ðŸš€Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚Â Â  â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ pages/
â”‚Â   Â 	â””â”€â”€ posts/Exposed Notes
â”œâ”€â”€ astro.config.mjs
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ tsconfig.json
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |
